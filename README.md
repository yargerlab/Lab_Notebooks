# Yarger Research Group - Lab Notebooks

Electronic Laboratory Notebooks in the Yarger Research Group.  All researchers are encouraged to keep a Jupyter / Colab Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN).  If possible, these notebooks will be synced here (if all the lab notebook information can be publicly shared, which is largely the case for most students and researchers).  The Yarger Lab strongly supports open science (https://www.cos.io/).
